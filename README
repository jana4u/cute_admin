CuteAdmin
=========

CuteAdmin is Ruby on Rails plug-in. It is mainly generator,
replacement of classic Ruby on Rails scaffold.
Generated code allows you immediately to use advanced features
such as pagination, ordering, search and i18n translations.

CuteAdmin is based on ActiveRecord extension Searchlogic.

CuteAdmin works fine with Ruby on Rails 2.2 and 2.3.


Installation
============

In your rails application folder run:

  `./script/plugin install git://github.com/jana4u/cute_admin.git`


CuteAdmin requires Searchlogic. You can use a gem (recommended):

  `sudo gem install searchlogic`

Don't forget to add it to config/environment.rb:

  config.gem "searchlogic"

Or you can install it as a rails plug-in:

  `./script/plugin install git://github.com/binarylogic/searchlogic.git`


You should install I18nLabel rails plug-in too:

  `./script/plugin install git://github.com/iain/i18n_label.git`

(I18nLabel is not necessary if you don't want to automaticaly translate labels
for ActiveRecord attributes using I18n.)


Usage
=====

1. generate models
2. run `rake db:migrate` to create database tables for your models
3. set associations (belongs_to, has_many etc.) in your models
4. set acts_as_cute_admin in your models
5. run `rake cute_admin:generate_with_associations`
   or you can run generator directly for selected model:
   `./script/generate cute_admin Developer --add-associated`


Example
=======

class Country < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_cute_admin
  has_many :companies
end

class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_cute_admin
  belongs_to :country
  has_many :developers
end

class Developer < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_cute_admin :display_name => :full_name, :order_by => [:last_name, :first_name]
  belongs_to :company

  def full_name
    "#{last_name}, #{first_name}"
  end
end
