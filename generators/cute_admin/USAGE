Description:
    Creates simple administration with filtering, ordering and pagination.
    It has built-in new i18n rails localization support.

    Pass the name of the existing model (in singular form), either CamelCased or
    under_scored. Relevant database table should be up-to-date before
    running the generator.

    For example, 'cute_admin Post' gives you controller that handles
    the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your posts, and
    an index that lists them, as well as a map.resources :posts
    declaration in config/routes.rb. You can filter and sort posts in index.
    If there are too many posts they will be paginated.

    If you pass '--add-associated' parameter after the model name, then
    fields from associated models will be added to index.
    You can use them for ordering and filtering.

    If you want to remove all the generated files, run
    'script/destroy cute_admin ModelName'.

Example:
    ./script/generate cute_admin Post

    ./script/generate cute_admin Post --add-associated
